# SdvBench: Microsoft SDV Benchmarks

## Coming Soon!

This repository contains a subset of the internal tests used by Microsoft's [Static Driver Verifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier) tool. These tests are generated from Window's Device Drivers, checking for various [properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff551714) that WDM drivers must satisfy. These represent one of the most comprehensive collection of verification benchmarks.
